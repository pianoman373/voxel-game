A yet unnamed project which aims to be a fully open source and moddable voxel game written in modern C++11 inspired by Minecraft and Minetest.

# Building

This project uses [cmake](http://www.cmake.org/download/) as it's build system. Setting up a project for your particular IDE via cmake is pretty simple
and instructions can be founs on the cmake website.

# Running

Voxel-game requires several files that are available from the root folder of the project and the resources folder. If you attempt to run
the program after a build the program will crash because it can't find the resources folder. To fix this set your working directory to the
project root folder for debugging/running.

# Contributing

Feel free to make a pull request if you have a feature or bugfix in mind or test out the game and submit issues to Github.
